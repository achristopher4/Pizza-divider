# Pizza-divider
CMPSC 101

You and several friends decide to order some pizzas, and you agree to split the cost.  It is assumed then that each person will get a fair share of the purchase, so the problem is to figure out how many slices that is.

The pizza slices must be divided as equally as possible, but slices will not be further cut into fractions.  It is possible that some will get one more slice more than others, but the difference must never be more than one.

You will be given the number of people involved, and the number of whole pizzas (where each pie is divided into eight slices.  Determine how many slices each may get.
